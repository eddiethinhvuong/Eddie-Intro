👋 Hi, it's Eddie! 

👀 I'm interested in big data analytics and machine learning as well as coding stuff.  
💼 I'm a senior data analyst currently learning machine learning to become a professional data scientist.   
🌱 I'm also learning Python and Javascript for web development, automation and scraping stuff, they're my hobbies and they help me at my job.  
✍️ Outside of the tech world, I also love writing.
